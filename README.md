## Undone Prototypes

This is a collection of experiments and resources to explore some of the proposed features of the Undone music blog redesign.


### Resources

#### Music players

- [Article on wordpress audio support](http://en.support.wordpress.com/audio/)
- [Soundcloud 'setplayer' might be a good option](http://en.support.wordpress.com/audio/soundcloud-audio-player/)
- ['Total control' player...](http://wordpress.org/plugins/total-control-html5-audio-player-basic/)
- [Player with playlist](http://wordpress.org/plugins/html5-mp3-player-with-playlist/)
- [Search of wordpress plugins](http://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/music-player)
- [An html 5 jquery player](http://wordpress.org/plugins/html5-jquery-audio-player/)
- [A pretty generic player](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-music-player/)
- [Flash music player](http://wpaudioplayer.com/)
- [Looks sort of bad...](http://www.cincopa.com/media-platform/wordpress-plugin/audio-player)
- We could work with an already ajaxed theme and stick a player in the navigation in the header.[This one is pretty dope](http://iworks.ozythemes.com/#!/home-page) but it’s also $45. I think it might be the user-experience Jack is looking for. Would be a pretty rad way to experience a music blog.
- This is also pretty sick. This guy just Ajaxed the Twenty-twelve theme. [See here](http://themes.wptheming.com/ajax-demo/)
- There’s also a plugin called [Ajaxed WordPress](http://ajaxedwp.com/). Loads simple WP Pages with Ajax.
